# Pokedex Exercise

First of all I took the resource from these 2 sites:
> 1. ![pokeapi](/pokeapi.png | width = 100 height = 150)  
[Poke API Website](https://pokeapi.co/)  
They provide everything about pokemon!  

> 2. ![bulba](/BULBA.png)  
[Bulbapedia Website](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name)  
I use this website for scraping pokemon images, they have bigger image
